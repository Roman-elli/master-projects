# Master Projects

This repository will gather some projects I develop during my Master’s in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, which I started in 2025.
Each folder will have its own README with more detailed documentation.

## Coming Soon

Since I’m just starting my Master’s, the projects are on their way! Stay tuned for experiments, learning projects, and practical applications in AI, machine learning, and data-driven solutions.
